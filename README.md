# Book Management App with Image Upload

## Quick Start
1. `git clone … && cd book-management-app`
2. ` server/.env` – add MongoDB & Cloudinary creds  
3. `npm install && npm --prefix server install && npm --prefix client install`
4. `npm run dev` – runs backend on :5000 and React on :3000

## Testing
`npm --prefix server test`

## Deployment
Set the same environment variables on your host (Heroku, AWS, etc.).  
Build the frontend with `npm --prefix client run build` and serve the static files or host separately.

## 🎯 Learning Context

This book management application was developed as **React Developer TASK 13** – a comprehensive challenge focused on implementing file upload functionality for book cover images.

Rather than building a complex enterprise app, this was a **learning-focused project** to master:
- Full-stack JS
- File handling
- Cloudinary integration
- Modern React development

---

## 🚀 What I Achieved

### ✅ Core Functionality Delivered
- ✅ Complete **CRUD** Operations (Books)
- ✅ **Image Upload** with live preview and validation
- ✅ **Cloudinary Integration** for secure scalable image hosting
- ✅ **Responsive UI** with clean UX
- ✅ **Postman-tested API** with structured endpoints
- ✅ Robust **error handling & validation**
